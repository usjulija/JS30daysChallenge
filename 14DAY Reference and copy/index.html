    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; //team is just a reference of players, therefore, by updating team, players array will update as well

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //if you pass nothing to slice it will take a copy of the original array
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Harry';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99; //will update the initial person object

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12}); //takes: empty oject, oject we want to copy, props we want to add
    console.log(capt2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person}; //not in js yet, will go only one level deep

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //if you update social, it will be updated in both objects
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //workaraund: you stringify object and then make it back
